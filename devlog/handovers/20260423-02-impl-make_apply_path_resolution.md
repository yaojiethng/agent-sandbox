# Agent Handover

**Session date:** 2026-04-23
**Milestone:** M2.3 — Apply Workflow: Capability Layer Diff Pipeline
**Session type:** Implementation
**Status:** Closed

## Objective

Implement Unit C (package-branch function) and fix `make apply` path resolution bug where `session-logs/` incorrectly wins lexicographic sort over timestamped diff directories.

## Scope

**Unit C tasks:**
1. Add `package_branch` function to `libs/diff.sh` — iterates commits since `INIT_SHA`, produces numbered `.diff` files with index lines stripped into `workspace/session-diffs/<branch-name>/`, overwrites on each run
2. Capture uncommitted changes in `diff_on_exit` — writes `git diff HEAD` with index lines stripped to `workspace/session-diffs/<session-name>/changes.diff` before committing
3. Update `diff_on_exit` to call `package_branch`
4. Retain `staged.diff`

**Bug fix (integrated with Unit C):**
5. Move `package_diff.sh` output to `$PARENT_DIR/diffs/${TIMESTAMP}-${LABEL}/changes.diff`
6. Update `make apply` to sort `$OUTPUT_DIR/diffs/` and use latest timestamped subfolder

**Naming convention fix:**
7. Rename `package_diff.sh` to `package_diff.sh` (underscores for script names)
8. Extract `package_branch` to standalone `libs/package_branch.sh`

**Backward compatibility removal:**
9. Force `SESSION_NAME` to be required in `diff_on_exit` and `diff_on_autosave` (empty name no longer falls back to root)

**Tests:**
10. Add tests for `package_branch` function in `tests/test_diff.sh`
11. Update existing tests to require `SESSION_NAME`

Files to change:
- `libs/diff.sh` — remove `package_branch`, update `diff_on_exit`, require `SESSION_NAME`
- `libs/package_branch.sh` — new file
- `libs/package_diff.sh` — renamed from `package_diff.sh`, update output path
- `scripts/onboard.sh` — update path references
- `scripts/apply_workspace.sh` — update APPLY command resolution logic
- `tests/test_diff.sh` — add `package_branch` tests, update existing tests to require `SESSION_NAME`

## Carried forward

None.

## Acceptance criteria

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| `package_branch` produces numbered `.diff` files in `session-diffs/<branch-name>/` with no `index` lines | ✓ Accepted |
| `diff_on_exit` captures uncommitted changes to `session-diffs/<session-name>/changes.diff` before committing | ✓ Accepted |
| `diff_on_exit` calls `package_branch` on session exit | ✓ Accepted |
| `package_diff.sh` writes to `$OUTPUT_DIR/diffs/<timestamp>-<label>/changes.diff` | ✓ Accepted |
| `make apply` sorts `$OUTPUT_DIR/diffs/` and uses latest timestamped subfolder | ✓ Accepted |
| All script names use underscores; `package-diff` (dash) only in prompt template | ✓ Accepted |
| `SESSION_NAME` required for `diff_on_exit` and `diff_on_autosave` (backward compat removed) | ✓ Accepted |
| `package_branch` tests pass (numbered diffs, index strip, branch sanitization, no commits) | ✓ Accepted |
| All `tests/test_diff.sh` tests pass (35 tests) | ✓ Accepted |

## Hot files

| File | Why in scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `libs/diff.sh` | Removed `package_branch`; updated `diff_on_exit` to source `package_branch.sh`; require `SESSION_NAME` | ✓ Complete |
| `libs/package_branch.sh` | New file: extracted `package_branch` function | ✓ Complete |
| `libs/package_diff.sh` | Renamed from `package_diff.sh`; updated output path to `/diffs/` subfolder | ✓ Complete |
| `scripts/onboard.sh` | Updated `package_diff.sh` path references | ✓ Complete |
| `scripts/apply_workspace.sh` | APPLY command reads from OUTPUT_DIR — update resolution logic | ✓ Complete |
| `tests/test_diff.sh` | Added `package_branch` tests; updated existing tests to require `SESSION_NAME` | ✓ Complete |

## Decisions made this session

| Decision | Rationale | Where recorded |
|---|---|---|
| Rename `package_diff.sh` to `package_diff.sh` | Consistency: underscores for script names and functions; dashes only for prompt template names | Handover |
| Extract `package_branch` to `libs/package_branch.sh` | Separation of concerns; `diffs.sh` contains only diff pipeline functions | Handover |
| Remove backward compatibility for empty `SESSION_NAME` | Session-scoped functions now require explicit session names; fallback behavior removed | Handover |
| Add `package_branch` tests to `tests/test_diff.sh` | Per testing_policy: functions with meaningful logic need tests | Handover |

## Completed this session

| File | Change summary |
|---|---|
| `libs/diff.sh` | Removed `package_branch` function; updated `diff_on_exit` to source `package_branch.sh`; require `SESSION_NAME` for `diff_on_exit` and `diff_on_autosave` |
| `libs/package_branch.sh` | New file: extracted `package_branch` function from `diffs.sh` |
| `libs/package_diff.sh` | Renamed from `package_diff.sh`; changed output path to `$PARENT_DIR/diffs/${TIMESTAMP}-${LABEL}/changes.diff` |
| `scripts/onboard.sh` | Updated `package_diff.sh` path references |
| `scripts/apply_workspace.sh` | Updated APPLY command to sort `$OUTPUT_DIR/diffs/` instead of `$OUTPUT_DIR/` |
| `tests/test_diff.sh` | Added 4 `package_branch` tests; updated existing tests to require `SESSION_NAME`; 35 tests pass |

## Deferred items

None.

## Next session

**Sub-milestone:** M2.3 — Apply Workflow: Capability Layer Diff Pipeline.
**Session type:** Implementation — Unit D (`make apply` update).

Read `docs/devlog/roadmap.md` M2.3 pending section for Unit D tasks.

**Watch-outs:**
- `package_diff.sh` output now in `workspace/output/diffs/` — all subsequent units should use this path
- `diff_on_exit` now captures uncommitted changes to `workspace/session-diffs/<session-name>/changes.diff`
- Script naming: `package_diff.sh` and `package_branch.sh` (underscores); `package-diff` (dash) only in prompt template

**Grep to run:** `grep -r "OUTPUT_DIR" scripts/apply_workspace.sh` — verify all paths updated to use `diffs/` subfolder.
